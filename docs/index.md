It is based on the Open Source JavaScript library [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) and the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework.
The Masterportal is developed under the MIT License by a group of public authorities in Germany. Visit [masterportal.org](https://masterportal.org) for more information.
