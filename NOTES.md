## Update Masterportal Code

Go to Actions on Github and run _Sync Bitbucket dev_vue to GitHub_
This will update the branch _bitbucket_dev_vue_ by pulling the code from https://bitbucket.org/geowerkstatt-hamburg/masterportal.git from the "main" branch called _dev_vue_.
Now you can merge the _bitbucket_dev_vue_ branch with the _main_ branch.
