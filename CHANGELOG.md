## 2024-06-27 v3.0.0
### __Breaking Changes__
- GetFeatureInfo:
    - module was renamed from `gfi`.
    - `desktopType` was removed, `detached` and `attached` are no longer provided, getFeatureInfo is displayed in sidebar.

- Moved config.json-Parameter `twoFingerPan` from `portalConfig.map.mapView` to `portalConfig.map.mapView.mapInteractions.interactionModes`.

Under the headline `deprecated` you can find several changes of removed deprecated properties and tools.
In certain circumstances this means that you have to update your portal files (index.html, config.js and config.json) according to the new changes in order to use your portal furthermore.

### Added
- Added config.json-Parameter `Portalconfig.tree.singleBaselayer`. Specifies whether only one base layer may be active at any time selectable by radio-buttons in visible layers.
- Added config.json-Parameter `Portalconfig.tree.showFolderPath`. Determines whether the folder structure of visible layers is displayed. Default is false.
- Added Shared Component for spinner.
- Added Shared Component for accordion.
- Added Shared Component for table with sort,display and download options.
- ShareView:
    - Legend, Layer information, getFeatureInfo, draw_old and wfsSearch can be shared.
    - bufferAnalysis can be shared even if it is configured in both menus.
- 3D: Min- and MaxScale are now available for layers.
- Print: An option "Improve scaling resolution" is implemented for 3d Layers to supply an improved and better resolution.
- WfsSearch:
    - A prop `resetParcelSearch`, so that the wfs search parameter could be resetted from outside component.
    - A prop `zoomLevelProp`. Can be used to set a zoom level (after search) that is different from the configured one.
- Filter:
    - A new parameter `closeGfi` to give an option if a gfi window is open, and it could be closed after a new filtering.
    - A new parameter `universalSearch` in snippet with type "featureInfo" to enable to search the attribute value in webpage.
    - A new parameter `beautifiedAttrName` in snippet with type "featureInfo" to supply beautified names for attributes.
    - A new parameter `adjustOnlyFromParent` in snippet (up to now only for "Dropdown" type) to allow adjust just from parent snippet.
    - A new parameter `linkText` to show a url link to the current filter setting at the bottom of the filter component.
    - A new parameter `allowEmptySelection` in snippet with type "dropdown" to allow all values to be deselected.
    - A new component `SnippetChart`. SnippetChart can be configured as a one of the filter snippets and renders a chart as a visual representation of the data that result from the current filter settings. Makes use of BarchartItem (LinechartItem and PiechartItem may be added in the future), which uses the chart.js library and its various configuration options.
    - A new parameter `alternativeTextForEmptyChart` in snippet type "chart" that can be displayed instead of chart.
    - A new parameter `initialStartupReset` which allows to show a reset button and reset the filter back to initial setup. It prevents the adjusting so it should not be used as a reset for filter configurations without a child snippet.
    - A new parameter `subtitle` in snippet type "chart" which allows to display any combination of text and data as a subtitle.

    - New config.json parameter 'tree' added. Contains:
        - 'type' (was 'treeType' or 'Baumtyp' at root before), the following params are possible: "auto" ( = old "default")
        - 'addLayerButton': if active:true, a button to add layers is shown. On the first menu side only Layers configured in config.json with attribute 'showInLayerTree':true or "visibility": true is shown.
        - 'validLayerTypesAutoTree' (new parameter) only for tree type 'auto'
        - 'layerIDsToIgnore' (moved from config.js) only for tree type 'auto'
        - 'metaIDsToMerge' (moved from config.js) only for tree type 'auto'
        - 'metaIDsToIgnore' (moved from config.js) only for tree type 'auto'
        - 'layerIDsToStyle' (moved from config.js) only for tree type 'auto'
        - 'categories': only for tree type 'auto', contains categories in datasets of layers. Tree is structured by them.
    - The configuration of 'Themenconfig' changed: Layers are contained in "elements"-Array and have type "layer", folders have type "folder." Type "layer" is default and can be omitted.
    - The attribute 'cache' on the layer is no longer taken into account with tree.type 'auto
    - 'supportedTreeTypes': attributes 'supportedDevices' and 'supportedMapModes' are added to each module to make it configurable in which tree type the module should be displayed.
    - The configuration for `mouseHover` is moved from config.js to config.json. Also, the configuration is now optional.
    - The width of the ScaleLine [in cm] can now be configured with the attribute `scaleLineWidth`.
    - It is now possible to configure a search interface more than once. For example `elasticSearch`.
- Modules/Controls:
    - Controls: a control can only be configured in config.json as "expandable". "bottomControl" is no longer supported.
    - GetFeatureInfo:
        - The `gfi` module has been renamed to `getFeatureInfo` and is now configured at the top level in config.json/portalconfigs.
        - The menu side can be accessed under `Portalconfig.getFeatureInfo.menuSide`.
    - The `startTool` control has been renamed to `startModule`. Modules are now completely configured within the control.
    - The `saveSelection` module can now be found as `Copy link` within the `shareSelection` module.
    - PortalFooter
        - The Footer has been renamed to `portalFooter` and its configuration has been moved from config.js to config.json.
        - The `scaleLine` is now a fixed part of the `portalFooter` and is configured within it.
        - In the `portalFooter` only `urls` and the `scaleLine` are configured. For the other contents e.g. `version` or `footerInfo` a module is created in the menu. Language switching has also been moved to a separate `language` module.
    - The 'active' attribute has been removed from the modules. Instead, a module to be displayed initially can now be defined centrally for each menu window with the attribute `currentComponent`.
    - LayerIds can no longer be configured as Object in the layer configuration (config.json). Instead the suffix `#` should be used to use a LayerId more than once.
    - The `mapMarker` is now a part of `map`.
    - You can configure the possibility to add attachments to the `contact` form.
    - `Menu`: the menu has been refactored and changed completely from horizontal menu bar to sidebar navigation.
    - `Searchbar`: The searchbar has been refactored with new options e.g. that the order of the search results can be configured accordingly the order of the searchInstances in the config.json. Furthermore, the search results are categorized by the different search categories. ClickEvents can be defined for search results (e.g. zooming to results). Furthermore, buttons can be defined for the individual search interfaces, which are displayed at each search result that is visible after clicking on "show all". E.g. for addresses, a button can be configured that allows to open the routing module with a certain start address. Starting a search directly with an address zooms to the search result and places a mapMarker.
- Libraries:
    - Update from vue 2 to vue 3
    - Time library moment.js has been replaced with day.js.
- Script to migrate masterportal configuration files to version 3.0.0 was added. The command `npm run migrateConfig` prompts for input and `npm run migrateConfig help` describes usage with parameters.
